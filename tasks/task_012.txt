## 2. Create REPORT.md with Architecture Details [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive REPORT.md that documents the system architecture, design decisions, and technical implementation
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a REPORT.md file in the project root
2. Document the high-level system architecture with diagrams (consider using Mermaid or PlantUML)
3. Explain key design decisions and their rationale
4. Detail the database schema and relationships
5. Document the component structure and interactions
6. Include performance considerations and optimizations
7. Discuss security measures implemented
8. Add sections on scalability and future improvements

Testing approach:
- Review with technical team members for accuracy
- Ensure all diagrams render correctly on GitHub
- Verify all architectural components are documented

## 3. Document API Endpoints with Swagger [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement Swagger or similar tool to document all API endpoints with examples and response schemas
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Install and configure Swagger/OpenAPI in the project
2. Add annotations to all API endpoints in the codebase
3. Document request parameters, body schemas, and response formats
4. Include authentication requirements for protected endpoints
5. Add example requests and responses for each endpoint
6. Generate and verify the Swagger UI interface
7. Ensure the documentation is accessible at a standard endpoint (e.g., /api-docs)

Testing approach:
- Verify all endpoints are documented correctly
- Test the Swagger UI to ensure it's accessible and functional
- Validate that example requests work as documented
- Check that all response schemas match actual API responses

## 4. Create Environment Setup Guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop a detailed environment setup guide covering development, testing, and production environments
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a separate ENVIRONMENT.md file or dedicated section in README.md
2. Document all required environment variables with descriptions and example values
3. Provide instructions for setting up development environment
4. Include configuration for testing environment
5. Document production deployment configuration
6. Add instructions for database setup and migrations
7. Include details on third-party service configurations
8. Create example .env files for different environments (with dummy values)

Testing approach:
- Verify guide by setting up a fresh environment following the instructions
- Test that all configurations work as expected
- Ensure security best practices are followed (no real credentials in examples)

## 5. Perform Integration and End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Implement and execute comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests to verify system functionality
### Details:
Implementation steps:
