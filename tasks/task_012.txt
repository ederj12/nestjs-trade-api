Implementation steps:
1. Install and configure Swagger/OpenAPI in the project
2. Add annotations to all API endpoints in the codebase
3. Document request parameters, body schemas, and response formats
4. Include authentication requirements for protected endpoints
5. Add example requests and responses for each endpoint
6. Generate and verify the Swagger UI interface
7. Ensure the documentation is accessible at a standard endpoint (e.g., /api-docs)

Testing approach:
- Verify all endpoints are documented correctly
- Test the Swagger UI to ensure it's accessible and functional
- Validate that example requests work as documented
- Check that all response schemas match actual API responses

## 4. Create Environment Setup Guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop a detailed environment setup guide covering development, testing, and production environments
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a separate ENVIRONMENT.md file or dedicated section in README.md
2. Document all required environment variables with descriptions and example values
3. Provide instructions for setting up development environment
4. Include configuration for testing environment
5. Document production deployment configuration
6. Add instructions for database setup and migrations
7. Include details on third-party service configurations
8. Create example .env files for different environments (with dummy values)

Testing approach:
- Verify guide by setting up a fresh environment following the instructions
- Test that all configurations work as expected
- Ensure security best practices are followed (no real credentials in examples)

## 5. Perform Integration and End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Implement and execute comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests to verify system functionality
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Identify critical user flows and system integrations to test
2. Set up integration testing framework if not already in place
3. Implement integration tests for all API endpoints
4. Create end-to-end tests for key user journeys
5. Test error handling and edge cases
6. Verify system behavior under load or stress conditions
7. Document test results and any issues found
8. Set up CI pipeline for automated testing if not already configured

Testing approach:
- Run all tests in isolated test environment
- Verify test coverage meets project requirements
- Document any bugs or issues in the issue tracker
- Ensure tests are repeatable and reliable

## 6. Ensure Code Quality and Perform Refactoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Implement code quality checks, run linting tools, and perform necessary code refactoring
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Configure ESLint with appropriate rules for the project
2. Set up and run code formatting tools (e.g., Prettier)
3. Execute linting across the entire codebase
4. Address all linting errors and warnings
5. Identify code smells and technical debt
6. Refactor problematic code sections
7. Improve code organization and structure where needed
8. Review and optimize performance bottlenecks
9. Ensure consistent coding standards throughout the project

Testing approach:
- Run automated tests after refactoring to ensure functionality is preserved
- Verify that linting passes with no errors
- Conduct code reviews for significant refactoring changes
- Document any architectural improvements made during refactoring

### Implementation Rules to Follow

- **Cursor Rules:**  
  - Use clear, actionable, and DRY rules.  
  - Reference actual code and keep rules up to date.  
  - Use code blocks and file references as per [cursor_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor_rules.mdc).

- **Development Workflow:**  
  - Use Task Master tools for all task management.  
  - Log detailed plans and progress in each subtask using `update_subtask`.  
  - Mark subtasks as `in-progress` when starting, and `done` when complete.  
  - Commit changes with clear, conventional messages.

- **NestJS/TypeScript:**  
  - Use modular architecture, DTOs, services, and controllers.  
  - Follow naming conventions and SOLID principles.  
  - Document public classes/methods with JSDoc.  
  - Write unit and e2e tests for all public functions.

- **Self-Improve:**  
  - Update or add rules if new patterns emerge or repeated issues are found.
