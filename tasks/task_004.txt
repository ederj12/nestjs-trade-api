# Task ID: 4
# Title: Stock Caching Mechanism
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement caching system for stock data considering 5-minute price updates
# Details:
Create a caching service that stores stock data in memory and/or database. Implement a mechanism to refresh stock prices every 5 minutes. Use NestJS cache module or implement a custom solution. Ensure cache invalidation works correctly. Add background job to periodically update stock prices from the vendor API.

# Test Strategy:
Test cache hit/miss scenarios. Verify cache invalidation after 5 minutes. Measure performance improvements with caching enabled vs. disabled.
