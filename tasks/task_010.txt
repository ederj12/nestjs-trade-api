# Task ID: 10
# Title: Reporting Service Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create service for generating daily transaction reports
# Details:
Implement a service to generate daily transaction reports. Create data aggregation logic to summarize successful and failed transactions. Format report data for email delivery. Implement scheduling using NestJS schedule module or similar. Store report history in the database.

# Test Strategy:
Test report generation with various transaction scenarios. Verify data aggregation accuracy. Test scheduling functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Database Schema for Report Storage [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the database schema to store report history and metadata
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a new entity class `ReportEntity` with fields for: id, reportDate, generatedAt, reportType, status, totalTransactions, successfulTransactions, failedTransactions, reportData (JSON), emailDeliveryStatus
2. Set up appropriate indexes for efficient querying (e.g., by date, status)
3. Create a repository class for the report entity
4. Implement database migrations
5. Add validation for entity fields

Testing approach:
1. Write unit tests for entity validation
2. Create integration tests to verify repository operations
3. Test edge cases like storing large report data

## 2. Implement Transaction Data Aggregation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create service to query and aggregate transaction data for reporting
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a `ReportAggregationService` class with methods to query transaction data for a specific date range
2. Implement aggregation logic to calculate: total transaction count, successful transactions, failed transactions, transaction volume, average transaction value
3. Add grouping by transaction types, payment methods, and time intervals (hourly)
4. Implement caching strategy for expensive aggregation operations
5. Handle edge cases: no transactions, only failed transactions, partial data

Testing approach:
1. Unit test each aggregation function with mock data
2. Test with various date ranges (single day, week, month)
3. Test edge cases with empty datasets and boundary conditions
4. Benchmark performance with large datasets

## 3. Create Report Formatting Service [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Implement service to format aggregated data into structured reports for email delivery
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a `ReportFormattingService` with methods to transform aggregated data into structured formats
2. Implement HTML email template with responsive design
3. Add support for different report formats (HTML, plain text, CSV attachment)
4. Create visualization helpers for key metrics (success rates, volume trends)
5. Implement localization support for dates and currency values

Testing approach:
1. Unit test formatting functions with various input data
2. Validate HTML output against email client compatibility
3. Test rendering of edge cases (zero values, extremely large values)
4. Verify CSV generation with different data structures

## 4. Implement Report Generation Service [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create the core reporting service that orchestrates data aggregation, formatting, and storage
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a `ReportGenerationService` that coordinates the end-to-end report generation process
2. Implement methods to trigger report generation for a specific date
3. Add transaction isolation to prevent duplicate report generation
4. Implement error handling and retry logic for failed report generation
5. Add logging for each step of the report generation process
6. Create event emitters for report generation lifecycle events

Testing approach:
1. Unit test the orchestration logic with mocked dependencies
2. Integration test the full report generation flow
3. Test error handling and recovery scenarios
4. Test concurrent report generation requests

## 5. Implement Report Scheduling with NestJS [done]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Set up scheduled tasks to automatically generate daily reports
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Configure NestJS Schedule module in the application
2. Create a `ReportSchedulerService` with scheduled tasks for daily report generation
3. Implement configurable schedule times via environment variables
4. Add distributed locking mechanism to prevent duplicate execution in clustered environments
5. Implement manual trigger endpoint for on-demand report generation
6. Add monitoring for scheduled task execution

Testing approach:
1. Unit test scheduler configuration
2. Integration test with mocked time to verify scheduling
3. Test manual trigger functionality
4. Verify locking mechanism in multi-instance scenarios

## 6. Implement Email Delivery Service [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Create service to deliver generated reports via email
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create an `EmailDeliveryService` to send formatted reports
2. Configure email transport (SMTP, SES, etc.) with appropriate settings
3. Implement recipient management (configurable distribution lists)
4. Add retry logic for failed email deliveries
5. Implement tracking of delivery status
6. Create templates for different report types
7. Add support for attachments (CSV data exports)

Testing approach:
1. Unit test email formatting and configuration
2. Integration test with test email accounts
3. Test retry and error handling logic
4. Verify attachment generation and delivery

## 7. Implement Report Management API [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6
### Description: Create REST endpoints to manage reports and view report history
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a `ReportController` with endpoints for: listing reports, getting report details, triggering manual report generation, re-sending reports
2. Implement filtering and pagination for report history
3. Add authentication and authorization for report access
4. Create DTOs for report requests and responses
5. Implement input validation and error handling
6. Add Swagger documentation for API endpoints

Testing approach:
1. Unit test controller methods with mocked services
2. Integration test API endpoints with test database
3. Test authentication and authorization rules
4. Verify pagination and filtering functionality
5. Load test with large report history
