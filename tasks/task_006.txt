# Task ID: 6
# Title: Portfolio Management Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement service for managing user stock portfolios
# Details:
Create a service to manage user portfolios. Implement methods to retrieve, create, and update portfolio entries. Calculate portfolio valuation based on current stock prices. Handle edge cases like empty portfolios or invalid stock references. Ensure data consistency when updating portfolios.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for portfolio calculations. Test edge cases and error scenarios. Verify portfolio valuation accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Portfolio Data Model and Repository Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the data model for portfolios and create the repository interface for CRUD operations
### Details:
1. Define a Portfolio entity class with fields for userId, portfolioId, name, and a collection of portfolio entries (stocks)
2. Define a PortfolioEntry entity with fields for stockSymbol, quantity, purchasePrice, and purchaseDate
3. Create a PortfolioRepository interface with methods for findByUserId, findById, save, update, and delete
4. Implement validation annotations on the entity classes
5. Create necessary DTOs for API requests and responses
6. Test the model by creating sample portfolio objects and validating constraints

## 2. Implement Portfolio Repository and Basic CRUD Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create the repository implementation and service methods for basic portfolio management
### Details:
1. Implement the PortfolioRepository interface with a database-specific implementation
2. Create a PortfolioService class with methods to create, retrieve, update and delete portfolios
3. Implement error handling for cases like portfolio not found, unauthorized access
4. Add transaction management to ensure data consistency
5. Implement pagination for retrieving multiple portfolios
6. Write unit tests for the service methods using mock repository
7. Test with different scenarios including empty portfolios and invalid inputs

## 3. Implement Portfolio Valuation Calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create functionality to calculate current portfolio value based on stock prices
### Details:
1. Create a StockPriceService interface to fetch current stock prices
2. Implement a method in PortfolioService to calculate total portfolio value
3. Calculate individual stock values (quantity * current price)
4. Handle cases where stock price data is unavailable
5. Implement caching for stock prices to improve performance
6. Calculate portfolio performance metrics (gain/loss, percentage change)
7. Write unit tests with mock stock price data
8. Test edge cases like empty portfolios and portfolios with delisted stocks

## 4. Implement Portfolio Update Operations with Consistency Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Create methods to update portfolio entries with validation and consistency checks
### Details:
1. Implement methods to add, update, and remove stocks from a portfolio
2. Add validation for stock symbols before adding to portfolio
3. Implement optimistic locking to prevent concurrent update issues
4. Create transaction boundaries to ensure atomic updates
5. Implement business rules validation (e.g., non-negative quantities)
6. Add logging for all portfolio modifications
7. Write unit tests for update operations including concurrent update scenarios
8. Test with various edge cases like updating non-existent entries

## 5. Create REST API Endpoints for Portfolio Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Implement REST controllers to expose portfolio management functionality
### Details:
1. Create a PortfolioController with endpoints for CRUD operations
2. Implement endpoint for retrieving portfolio valuation
3. Add request validation and proper error responses
4. Implement pagination and sorting for portfolio listing
5. Add authentication and authorization checks
6. Document API endpoints using Swagger/OpenAPI
7. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
8. Write integration tests for all endpoints
9. Test performance with large portfolios
