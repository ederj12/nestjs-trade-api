# Fuse Finance Stock Trading Backend Service PRD

## Project Overview
Development of a production-ready backend service for stock trading operations that integrates with Fuse's mock vendor API. The service will handle stock listings, portfolio management, and transaction processing with a focus on reliability and real-time price accuracy.

## Core Requirements

### Technology Stack
- Node.js backend service (Nestjs)
- Database system (Postgresql) with Docker
- Email service integration for reports
- Typescript
- Eslint

### API Integration
Base URL: https://api.challenge.fusefinance.com
Authentication: x-api-key header required (value: nSbPbFJfe95BFZufiDwF32UhqZLEVQ5K4wdtJI2e)

### Required Features

1. Stock Listing Service
   - Integrate with vendor API to fetch available stocks
   - Handle pagination using nextToken system
   - Cache stock data appropriately considering 5-minute price updates
   - Implement error handling for unreliable vendor API

2. Portfolio Management
   - Retrieve and manage user stock portfolios
   - Track stock quantities per user
   - Maintain accurate portfolio valuations

3. Transaction Processing
   - Execute stock purchase transactions
   - Validate transaction prices (within 2% of current stock price)
   - Implement robust error handling
   - Record transaction outcomes

4. Reporting System
   - Generate daily email reports
   - Include successful and failed transactions
   - Implement reliable email delivery system

### Technical Considerations

1. Reliability Requirements
   - Handle vendor API downtime gracefully
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Maintain data consistency
   - Log all critical operations

2. Price Management
   - Track stock price updates (every 5 minutes)
   - Implement price validation logic (2% threshold)
   - Handle price synchronization

3. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive error handling for API failures
   - Transaction validation errors
   - System-level error management

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Performance
   - Fast response times for API endpoints
   - Efficient data caching
   - Optimized database queries

2. Scalability
   - Design for potential high load
   - Efficient resource utilization
   - Modular architecture

3. Security
   - Secure API key management
   - Data validation
   - Error message security

4. Maintainability
   - Clean code architecture
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Clear logging
   - Modular design

### Deliverables

1. Source Code
   - Production-ready implementation
   - Clean commit history
   - Clear commit messages

2. Documentation
   - README.md with setup instructions
   - REPORT.md with architecture details
   - API documentation
   - Environment setup guide

3. Testing
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - API endpoint tests

### Out of Scope
- User management endpoints (GET/UPDATE/DELETE users)
- Transaction listing endpoint
- Frontend development
- User authentication system
